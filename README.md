# Object-Motion-Detection
This project implements a simple and effective Object Motion Detection system using Python and OpenCV. The program captures frames from the webcam, processes them, and detects movement by comparing each frame with a dynamically updated background model.

Whenever motion is detected, the moving region is highlighted with bounding boxes, and the status is printed on the screen.

✨ Features :

Motion detection using background subtraction
Automatic background model updating
Contour-based detection for accurate movement tracking
Bounding boxes drawn around detected moving objects
Frame-by-frame image capturing using Colab webcam (JavaScript + Python integration)
Easy-to-understand and beginner-friendly code structure

🛠 Technologies Used :

Python
OpenCV
NumPy
Imutils
JavaScript (for webcam access in Google Colab)

🎯 Use Cases :

Basic security system prototype
Activity monitoring
Motion-triggered automation
Learning computer vision fundamentals
